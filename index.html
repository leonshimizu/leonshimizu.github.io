				<h2 class="major">About</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="family_full.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>In high school, I took a Computer Science class and really enjoyed it but I didn’t ever think much of
					Computer Science or really coding in general, until a few months ago. Then, around May, I saw that at Amazon
					(where I worked at the time), they had a program called Career Choice, where they’d pay 95% of the tuition for
					you to learn different trades (provided that you’ve been a permanent employee for a year), a couple of them
					being web development and cyber security analysis. By this time, I was about a month or two away from hitting
					the year mark so I was doing research on if this is something I’d really like to do. Then about a couple weeks
					later, I heard that my cousin went through a coding bootcamp and now she’s a software developer with Indeed.
					That really caught my eye so I began messaging her and asking her questions about what she did and different
					options that I could look into. She then let me know that she has a friend that works for Amazon and is in a
					program called the Amazon Technical Academy, which is basically a program to teach software development to
					Amazon employees. From there, I began to get more and more interested because it was a program where, provided
					you were accepted into the program, you’d go on leave for about 9-10 months and be paid a monthly stipend to
					pretty much go to school for software development. At the time, it sounded like a no-brainer, so I began doing
					the pre-requisite classes (which is where most if not all of my previous coding experience is from) and also
					started the applications. However, as time went on and I did more research, I discovered that if possible, I’d
					like to join a program that teaches me how to code sooner rather than later. One of the main reasons being due
					to my job at the time, I was a Process Assistant at Amazon, which was a job that I loved and I had a great
					team but it was pretty physically demanding and we were only going to get busier as we approached the end of
					the year. Then I met an auntie that I haven’t seen in years and she was telling me how she got into software
					development and the coding bootcamp she did. She actually went to Actualize and had nothing but good things to
					say about the program. Hearing from her made me want to start a coding bootcamp even more so I talked to her
					for a while about the different options and what I could do to figure out if it’s the right way to go and then
					if it is, how I should go about figuring out what program I should go with. From there I began researching and
					applying to almost any bootcamp I could, to see what their program is like and if it would be a good fit for
					me. Also, I was reaching out to people that were currently in or have completed bootcamps to see what they
					have to say on the different programs, and for the most part, I only heard good things from everyone. From
					there, I decided that I wanted to go all in with a coding bootcamp instead of the ATA and quit my job, it was
					just a matter of where. The ATA is still a great program, however, due to time (with the ATA, I wouldn’t know
					if I was in the program until November and then the program itself wouldn’t start until February and then I
					wouldn’t be done until around October/November, rather than with the bootcamps, I could start now) and
					sustainability (like I said, I loved my job and the people I was working with but if I could do something I
					love that also isn’t as physically demanding, I‘d prefer to do that), I chose to go with coding bootcamps
					instead. Also, at this point, I was interviewing with most of the schools I reached out to and was
					consistently talking to my family about where would be the best fit. Finally, we decided on Actualize for a
					few reasons, the smaller average teacher to student ratio, the program’s teachers all had a teaching
					background, when I made a post on LinkedIn about what everyone thought was the best program to go with, only
					Actualize people replied, and lastly the conversations I had with my auntie about the school completely sold
					me on the program. </p>
